# SQL Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes an anonymized dataset related to airlines, air traffic, and airports using SQL. The original dataset has been anonymized to protect privacy, and only SQL scripts are shared for demonstration purposes.

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

In this project, I worked with:
- ✈️ **Airline Data**: An anonymized dataset containing information on airlines, airports, flights, and air traffic.
- 🗂️ **Pre-existing Tables**: The dataset provided all necessary tables, and no new tables were created.
- 📝 **SQL Queries**: I solved key business questions through SQL queries to extract insights from the data.

## 📂 **Project Files**
- `SQL Capstone Project.docx`: Contains all the SQL queries used to analyze the anonymized dataset and answer the business questions.
- `README.md`: This file explaining the project.

## 🚀 **Key Questions Solved**
- 🛬 **Flight Traffic**: Analyzed the busiest anonymized airports based on incoming and outgoing flights.
- ⏳ **Flight Delays**: Investigated average flight delays and identified anonymized airports with the highest delays.
- 🌍 **International vs. Domestic Flights**: Compared anonymized domestic and international flight volumes.
- 🏆 **Top Airlines**: Identified top-performing anonymized airlines based on flight traffic and passenger data.
- 📊 **Passenger Analysis**: Analyzed the number of passengers across anonymized airlines, routes, and airports.

## 🌟 **Features Demonstrated**

**Complex SQL queries including JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and window functions.**

**Data aggregation to provide insights on anonymized flight traffic and delays.**

**Analyzing anonymized relationships between airlines, airports, and routes.**
